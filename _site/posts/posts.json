    "contents": "\nI wanted to create a running list of interesting traffic calming measures that I’ve come across when traveling was a thing\nIceland\nIn the picture below, you can see a crosswalk, and if you look closely you can see that crosswalk is raised above the ground. In the short term, drivers break to avoid being jolted out of their seats; however, the long run effects of this traffic calming measure are a little more subtle. After driving over these crosswalks several times, drivers begin to associate the visual aesthetics of the crosswalk with the need to break every time. In effect, this ensures that drivers are always ready to break at a crosswalk, which is exactly what they should be doing if a pedestrian is in fact about to cross! In my experience, not all of the crosswalks were raised. However, there were certainly enough of them to ensure that I wouldn’t want to drive over them very quickly!\nP.S. Not all of the crosswalks have stop signs in front of them, but this was the best picture I could find\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn contrast, many crosswalks (below is a “zebra” crossing in the UK) are simply paint and thus drivers often have no need to break if there isn’t a pedestrian. Essentially, placing speed bumps around crosswalks removes any uncertainty as to what action a driver needs to take when they see a crosswalk.\n\nSouth Korea\nIn the video below, at around the 5 second mark, you can see a yellow and white speed bump. Pay attention to how the camera shakes after going over the speed bump. At around the 18 second mark, you can see a second yellow and white speed bump, note how the camera doesn’t shake after going over the second speed bump. This is because it’s not actually a speed bump, just yellow and white paint! By pairing yellow and white with enough speed bumps, drivers learn to associate these colors with slowing down, even though not everything that is painted yellow and white is actually a speed bump.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nFrom climate change to COVID-19 policy makers are looking to behavioral science to solve some of societies’ largest challenges. There are certainly a number of ways behavioral science can be used to help solve these problems. For example, helping policy makers decide which interventions are the most effective at increasing hand-washing or reducing energy consumption. Importantly, behavioral science is primarily meant to augment and improve existing policies, technology, and infrastructure, not replace them. Below I outline two cases that you can’t behavioral science your way out of.\nCOVID-19\nSince the start of the outbreak experts have resoundingly said that a key behavior to stemming the spread of the coronavirus is hand washing. As mentioned above, how to increase hand washing has been topic behavioral scientists have been studying for some time. One neat example depicted below illustrates how painting a walkway that leads to a hand washing station increased the number of students washing their hands from 4% to 74%.\n\nHowever, even with such shockingly large effects, the efficacy of hand washing nudges pale in comparison to the efficacy of a vaccine or the medical infrastructure Korea has built to enable quick and efficient testing. This isn’t to say that behavioral science shouldn’t be used to reduce the spread of the virus, rather it should be used to sharpen existing efforts. In the UK, the government delayed social distancing measures based on the dubious idea of behavioral fatigue. Even if we could precisely measure when people would get tired of social distancing, this would still not be a substitute for a vaccine or good medical infrastructure.\nClimate Change\nAs hand washing is to reducing the spread of COVID-19, making people ask for plastic straws is to climate change. The central idea behind making people asking for plastic straws (never mind banning them) is that people are unlikely to go out of their way to purposefully ask for them (friction costs), thus reducing the overall use of plastic straw and leading to reduced carbon emissions. An entirely more effective policy at reducing carbon emissions would be to develop policies that foster the growth of alternative energy technologies. It’s also curious as a society that the one policy we’ve decided is “extremely” important to prevent climate change is a policy that forces people with disabilities to spill their drinks on themselves and prevent them from participating in public life at large.\nConclusion\nIt’s inspiring how quickly behavioral scientists around the world have deftly pivoted to studying COVID-19 and the associated behavioral issues that spread its transmission. However, it’s also incumbent upon behavioral scientists to ensure that policy makers understand the evidence base of behavioral science and its limits.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIntro\nFor my first post I wanted to do something fun and simple. Jay Z recently turned 50 and in celebration of this momentous event he re-released his entire discography on Spotify (of which I am a subscriber). Needless to say, I have have been listening to a lot of Jay since the re-release. I always enjoyed the track Moment of Clarity in which Jay Z takes stock of his life and career, and in particular, how he modified his lyrics to achieve further commercial success. This change in marketing strategy is best encapsulated in the quote below from the track Moment of Clarity\n\nI dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars \nThey criticized me for it, yet they all yell holla\nIf skills sold, truth be told, I’d probably be lyrically Talib Kweli\nTruthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense\nBut I did 5 mill’ – I ain’t been rhyming like Common since (Whoo)\n\nEssentially, Jay Z is describing how he simplified his lyrics to sell more albums. He references how he would prefer to write verses more like Common and Talib Kweli who are towards the upper end of the distribution for vocabulary, yet feels compelled to trade moral victory for monetary success.\nOne natural question to ask is how much did Jay Z simplify his lyrics over his career.\nThe first step we need to take to answer this question is data! The genius package in R provides an easy way to access lyrics from genius.com. For this analysis we are only going to use Jay Z’s solo studio albums.\n\n\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(genius)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(png)\nlibrary(gifski)\njayz.albums <- tribble(\n       ~artist, ~album, ~Year,\n       \"Jay-z\", \"Reasonable-Doubt\",\"1996\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1\",\"1997\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life\",\"1998\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter\",\"1999\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"The Dynasty: Roc La Familia\",\"2000\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"The Blueprint\",\"2001\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"The-blueprint-2-the-gift-the-curse\", \"2002\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"The Black Album\", \"2003\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"Kingdom Come\",\"2006\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"American Gangster\",\"2007\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"The Blueprint 3\",\"2009\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"Magna Carta... Holy Grail\",\"2013\",\n       \"Jay-z\", \"4:44\",\"2017\",\n) \n\n\njayz.albums.filled <- jayz.albums %>%\n        add_genius(artist, album, \"album\")\n\njayz.albums.filled <- jayz.albums.filled %>% \n  mutate(album = case_when(\n    album == \"The-blueprint-2-the-gift-the-curse\" ~ \"The Blueprint 2 The Gift The Curse\",\n    album ==  \"Reasonable-Doubt\" ~ \"Reasonable Doubt\",\n    TRUE ~ album))\n\njayz.disc.tidy <- jayz.albums.filled %>% \n        unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>% \n        anti_join(stop_words) \n\n\n\nFindings\nLexical Diversity\nOne metric we could use to evaluate how much Jay Z simplified his lyrics is lexical diversity, which is the number of unique words (per album). The plot below shows the number of unique words per album declines over time particularly after The Black Album in which Jay Z expresses his desire to simplify his lyrics.\n\n\ndiversity <- jayz.disc.tidy %>% \n        group_by(Year, album) %>%\n        summarise(count = n_distinct(word)) %>%\n        ungroup() %>% \n        mutate(album = fct_reorder(album, Year)) %>% \n        ggplot(aes(album, count, group = 1)) +\n        geom_point() +\n        geom_line() +\n        geom_vline(xintercept = 8, linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"blue\") +\n        ylim(0,3000) +\n        labs(y = \"# of Distinct Words\", x = \"Album\") +\n        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\ndiversity <- diversity + transition_reveal(as.numeric(album)) +\n        geom_line(aes(x = album, y = count,\n                       group = 1)) \nanimate(diversity, renderer = gifski_renderer())\n\n\n\n\nLexical Density\nAnother metric we could is lexical density, which is the number of unique words (per album) divided by the number of words (per album). The plot below indicates that across albums, lexical density does not appear to vary nearly as much across albums as lexical diversity. Taken together with the plot above, this suggests that the number of distinct words varies with the total # of words per album.\n\n\ndensity <-  jayz.disc.tidy %>% \n        group_by(Year,album) %>% \n        summarise(rate = n_distinct(word)/n()) %>%\n        ungroup() %>% \n        mutate(album = fct_reorder(album, Year)) %>% \n        ggplot(aes(album, rate, group = 1)) +\n        geom_point() +\n        geom_line() +\n        geom_vline(xintercept = 8, linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"blue\") +\n        ylim(0,1) +\n        labs(y = \"Rate of Distinct Words\", x = \"Album\") +\n        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\ndensity <- density + transition_reveal(as.numeric(album)) +\n        geom_line(aes(x = album, y = rate,\n                      group = 1)) \nanimate(density)\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can see more directly below that Jay Z also decreased the overall number of words per album as his career progressed.\n\n\nlength <- jayz.disc.tidy %>% \n        group_by(Year,album) %>% \n        summarise(n = n()) %>% \n        ungroup() %>% \n        mutate(album = fct_reorder(album, Year)) %>% \n        ggplot(aes(album, n, group = 1)) +\n        geom_point() +\n        geom_line() +\n        geom_vline(xintercept = 8, linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"blue\") +\n        ylim(0,7000) +\n        labs(y = \"Number of Words\", x = \"Album\") +\n        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\nlength <- length + transition_reveal(as.numeric(album)) +\n        geom_line(aes(x = album, y = n, group = 1)) \nanimate(length)\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nJay Z reduced both the number of distinct words per album as well as number of words overall per album after releasing the track Moment Clarity on The Black Album. Although, this does not necessarily mean that Jay Z simplified his topics or reduced the range of topics in his lyrics, rather he could be using simpler terms to describe equally complex topics throughout his discography.\n\n\n\n",
